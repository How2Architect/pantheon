# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is the "pantheon" repository - a collection of agentic systems designed to be run using claude-code and other AI tools.

## Project Structure

This is currently a minimal repository with:
- README.md - Basic project description
- LICENSE - MIT license file

## Agentic Systems
[Zeus](/pantheon/)

## Development Status

This appears to be a newly initialized repository for building AI agent systems. As the codebase grows, this file should be updated with:
- Specific agent architectures and patterns used
- Commands for building, testing, and running agents
- Integration details with claude-code and other AI tools
- Any specific coding conventions or architectural decisions

## Working with This Repository

Since this is an agentic systems repository designed for use with AI tools like claude-code:
- When adding new agents, follow established patterns once they emerge
- Document agent capabilities and interfaces clearly
- Consider how agents will interact with each other and external AI tools
