## Hosts of several Agentic systems that I use in daily life. This is my **life-os**

[7-Minds](https://howtoarchitect.io/7minds) uses my Obsidian vault and all the knowledge that I have been collected and helps me build Innovations. This is a collection of 7 agents that help me with research, search in my vault, create signals and then tie it all together into a storytelling narrative.

Compatible with
 - Claude Code, or any other AI tools
 - Works with you to generate and build over new ideas
